We are actively looking for internal and external sponsors to contribute to our event. Certain tiers of contributors have the right to set a challenge and host a workshop (or sponsor a workshop/talk by a third-party). Sponsors will be acknowledged throughout our promotional campaign and during the main event.

Reach us at [css@lsesu.org](mailto:css@lsesu.org?subject=Sponsorship) for more information on how to get involved.
