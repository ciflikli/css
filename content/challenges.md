We aim to have five distinct computational social science challenges for the participants to tackle throughout the event.  There will be two LSE faculty---Thomas Leeper and Milena Tsvetkova---who will be available for a couple of hours each day for your questions.

## GONGOs in the UN

-	GONGOs are government-sponsored NGOs
-	How to identify them? Funding, people, agenda
-	“Shadow reports” to UN Human Rights bodies
-	Case of the Universal Periodic Review
-	Case selection and issue of languages

Reports submitted by stakeholders (NGOs, academics and National Human Rights Institutions) can be found on the superscript number 3 for each state on the list:

Skills: Web scraping, text similarity, cluster reports  
Point of reference: Pilar Elizalde (Co-organiser, IR Department, LSE)  
Recommended workshop: Building text analysis models using ```quanteda```

## Social Mobility: Left-Behind

- People living in places (often termed the “rust belt” areas) that feel left behind by the economic changes of the last few decades (globalization, automation, etc.)
- Old industrial areas within the US, UK and Europe (e.g. the Ruhr region of Germany, the North East of France)
- To what extent are there shared characteristics across different "left-behind" places?
- Focus on social and urban dimensions

Skills: Web scraping, data visualisation, forecasting  
Point of reference: Dr. Rachel Carey (Zinc)  
Recommended workshop: Dive into ```dplyr```

## Similar Social Networks

-	There is an index that contains links to data on more than 4000 social, biological, technological and information networks (see https://icon.colorado.edu/)
-	How can we identify similar social networks? 
-	Find ways to cluster networks based on their structure and then identify what other properties unify structurally similar networks
-	This could help us identify universal network formation mechanisms across different domains.

Skills: Network analysis, network visualisation, web scraping  
Point of reference: Dr Milena Tsvetkova (Facilitator, LSE SEDS and Methodology Department, LSE)  
Recommended workshop: Introduction to SNA and network visualisation in ```R```

## Online Trolling Behaviour

-	Try to build a classifier around online trolling behaviour
-	Could be using comments on news posts
-	Or maybe playing with another API like reddit/Twitter/4chan or more open-ended

Skills: Relational databases, APIs, classification algorithms  
Point of reference: Dr Thomas Leeper (Facilitator, Government Department, LSE)  
Recommended workshop: Predictive Modeling with ```caret```

## Assessing the Open Source System

- Help us understand risks to the open source ecosystem
- Using big data and open source
- In open source, we have maintainers, contributors and consumers (or users)
- Recently a new role has appeared: sustainer
- The individual or organization who is concerned with the fragile state and future of highly-used and impactful open source projects.

Skills: Big data analytics, scaling  
Point of reference: Amy Dickens & Wilhelm Klopp (GitHub)  
Recommended workshop: Introduction to Version Control
