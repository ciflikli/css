We will host events throughout the hackathon. These will run in parallel with the main event; the participants can take a break from hacking and attend a workshop. Events are tied to sponsorships. Currently, we are expecting to host five technical workshops and one speaker panel.

### Introduction to SNA & Network visualisation in `R`
### <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-silvia-majo-vazquez">Sílvia Majó-Vázquez</a>, University of Oxford

<img src="images/majo-vazquez.jpg" width="200">

Sílvia Majó-Vázquez is a communication researcher and Post-doctoral Research Fellow at Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism of the University of Oxford. Her research areas include news audience behaviour, digital news structure and the role of digital-born and legacy media in the online news domain. As part of her dissertation, she studied how digital technologies are reconfiguring the news media ecology, borrowing tools from network science and using digital trace data. Currently, she is focused on assessing patterns of online news consumption at a comparative level by leveraging Facebook and Twitter data from the French, UK and German elections in 2017. Jointly with other colleagues, she is advancing the audience research field by proposing new methodological approaches to the study of new audience navigation patterns based on developments from network science (see Mukerjee, Majó-Vázquez, & González-Bailón, 2018). Her work has been published in Journal of Computer Mediated Communication and Journal of Communication among others (see list of publications [here](https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=en&user=kpSN-ugAAAAJ)).

### <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alschroeder/">Anna Louise Schröder</a>, XL Catlin
### <img src="images/schroder.jpg" width="200">

Anna is senior data scientist at the commercial insurer XL Catlin where she develops innovative solutions to complex (large and small) data problems. In her current role, she leads a team of data scientists in building a situational risk model for autonomous driving. This work entails close collaboration with a start-up that builds the autonomous software, to understand their system and derive a probabilistic framework relating the system performance to data that describe situational context like weather and traffic. Other responsibilities involve assessing the (typically ‘AI’ or ‘ML’ labelled) products of external tech vendors, and sharing knowledge about statistical methods for structured and unstructured data in internal trainings and workshops.
 
Anna has several years work experience ranging from banking to an e-commerce start up. She holds a PhD in Statistics from the London School of Economics, where she developed statistical methods for change-point detection with applications in finance and neuroscience. Anna has lived all around the world and loves exploring foreign cultures. In the overcrowded madness that is London, she tries to keep her sanity through cycling and rocket yoga.
