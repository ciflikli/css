We will host events throughout the hackathon. These will run in parallel with the main event; the participants can take a break from hacking and attend a workshop. Events are tied to sponsorships. Currently, we are expecting to host five technical workshops and one speaker panel.

Marc Cohen builds tools, demos, codelabs, and other things to make the Google Cloud Platform easier and more fun to use. Originally from New Jersey, then Seattle, and now lives and works in London. He co-authored a book about Google Compute Engine and wrote the product announcement demo. In a previous life, he developed communication systems at Bell Labs and Lucent Technologies. Outside of work, he enjoys indie music, quirky films (especially documentaries), books, puzzles, and chess. He's also very interested in education, teaching, and applying technology (like spaced repetition) to enhance the learning experience.

Dr. Claudia Vitolo is an Italian scientist working at the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), on forecasting natural hazards. Her work consists of developing tools and algorithms to facilitate the retrieval, modelling and visualisation of environmental forecasting data. These tools are used by first responders to act quickly and efficiently in case a natural hazard occurs. She is an open-advocate and addicted to the R statistical language. She organise meetups in the data science field as well as hackathons and Kaggle competitions. She is a member of the R-Ladies Global leadership team, a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community.
