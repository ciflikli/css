Are you interested in the intersection of social science and data science? Do you want to use your coding and data analysis skills to tackle social science problems? Are you looking for career opportunities in technology? If the answer to any of those questions is yes, you should participate in the 1st LSE Computational Social Science Hackathon!

The two-and-a-half day event will boast four computational social science challenges set by Facebook Research, GitHub, and LSE Social and Economic Data Science (one more TBA soon) that will be solved by groups of approximately 10-15 participants each. On top of that you can expect exciting R and Python workshops by experts from Google Cloud, GitHub, LSE, and R-Ladies London. Moreover, there will be an intersectional tech careers panel featuring practitioners from Google, Alan Turing Institute, and XL Catlin providing you with an invaluable opportunity to explore and learn from their career trajectories and kick-start your own tech career.

Stay tuned for the unveiling of our challenges in the upcoming weeks!

# FAQ

### Is it free to attend?

Absolutely! Reserve your free ticket [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/1st-lse-computational-social-science-hackathon-tickets-44515241285).

### Do I have to be affiliated with LSE in any way?

No, the event is open to all.

### I want to attend but I'm not sure my coding chops are good enough for [insert random criteria]

Do come; it's for learning and fun! There will be beginner-level workshops for R and Python, and guidance will be available throughout the event by LSE faculty and post-docs.

### What's the Pre-Event (April 17)?

It's when all participants gather for the first time and watch the challenge presentations (sponsors themselves won't be there during the pre-event). Afterwards, you will be able to mingle (drinks on us) and form teams. This ensures that you can all start hacking right away on the morning of the first day so don't skip it!

### Is there a cap on attendance?

Yes, maximum 50 participants.

### Will there be constant stream of coffee?

You got it.

All the food. Snacks during coffee breaks, 2 x lunch, and a dinner on Wednesday evening.

### What type of dinner?

Pizza, courtesy of Cambridge Spark! We will also offer healthy alternatives.

### Will there be freebies for everyone?

In the form of tote bags and t-shirts commemorating the occasion.

### What about prize packs for the first-place team?

We would like to keep it nice and friendly, but those might receive little [octocat figurines](https://github.myshopify.com/products/octocat-figurine)---thanks GitHub (:

### Will there be opportunities for networking?

Definitely! Senior data scientists from Google, Facebook Research, Cambridge Spark, XLCatlin will attend the event, in addition to campus experts from GitHub and LSE alumni working in tech. Make sure you say hello!
